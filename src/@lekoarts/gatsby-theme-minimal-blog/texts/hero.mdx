You'r *@mylette.rs* - my personal blog pages! I'm really happy sharing it with
you.

I'm Velibor - research PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, Sweden. This "jar of cookies" is primarily a medium for sharing
thoughts and fiddling with ideas about applied atmospheric science and
programming which many find uninteresting but are possibly amusing to some.
