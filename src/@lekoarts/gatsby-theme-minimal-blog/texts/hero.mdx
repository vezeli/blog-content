You'r @tinkersavenue and I'm really happy that your here.

I'm Velibor - research PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, Sweden. This "oasis" is primarily a medium for sharing thoughts and
fiddling with ideas about atmospheric science and programming which many find
uninteresting but are possibly amusing to some.
