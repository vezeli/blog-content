Problem with being a research PhD candidate is that it's hard to answer the
usual what-do-you-do question? If you could take a look at the title of the
founding application for the PhD project on which I am working it would
probably read *Turbulence Modelling of Stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layers
Using the Explicit Algebraic Reynolds-stress Model* or something along those
lines. Therefore, saying "I'm doing a PhD" and leaving people in a confused and
somewhat disappointed state of mind is the best I've got.

It was recently while talking with my uncle he mentioned that he remembers me
saying "Studying and getting payed is an equivalent of living the dream"
sometime during my undergraduate studies. Therefore, it comes as no surprise
that I have been studying at three different university (each in different
country) in the past nine years and I can honestly say that I enjoy being a PhD
student!

Apart from my daytime job, I'm also passionate about coding in Python and very
impressed with Haskell programming language. I'm collecting quite a number of
in-front-of-the-screen hours writing code and wrapping my head around various
programming concepts.
