When talking about design patterns object-oriented programming (OOP) and
functional programming (FP) are considered to be the opposites. FP is
characterised by lack of state and immutable data structures while OOP is
written using mutable data structures that represent state in programs. This
doesn't mean, however, that one cannot use FP to create "data holders" that
resemble objects in OOP (as we will show).

Even though Python is optimized for writing imperative programs (i.e., OOP) it
works fairly well for FP. It is mainly because Python supports the concept of
first-class functions. This allows Pythonistas and Pythoneers to treat
functions (with love and gratitude that they deserve) as if they are any other
object in Python. This post shows how to write functional Python using
first-class functions to bridge the gap between the FP and OOP. To have a
better understanding first we need to take a look at first-class functions and
lexical closure.

### Functions in Python are First-class Citizens

Support of first-class functions means that functions in Python behave like any
other object. They can be passed as functional arguments or returned from other
functions. Here's an example of a first-class function:

```py
def first_class_function(arg):
    def enclosed_function():
        return arg
    return enclosed_function
```

Every time `first_class_function` gets called it defines a new
`enclosed_function` as it's return value. Since `first_class_function` returns
another function it really is first class.

Note that `arg` and `enclosed_function` live only inside the namescope of
`first_class_function`. This means that the two objects can only be used inside
our `first_class_function`! Since these objects coexist in the same namespace
it also means that `enclosed_function` knows what is `arg` and can use it
inside it's own function namescope, this is called *lexical closure*. Lexical
closures capture the local state of functions and represent the ABC of
functional programming.

To call `enclosed_function` you have to first call `first_class_function` and
pass in an argument. This creates a lexical closure and returns a function
object called `enclosed_function`. The returned function object can be directly
called with no arguments:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> first_class_function("bar")()
'bar'
```

Otherwise, it can be assigned to a variable and called later:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> foo = first_class_function("bar")
>>> foo()
'bar'
```

In the second example, note that `foo` is a function returned from
`first_class_function`. It is important to realize that the argument `"bar"`
passed in `first_class_function` now lives inside `foo`. This means that
lexical closures can be used for storing objects inside functions. Object `foo`
behaves like any other (non-anonymous) function in Python, although keep in
mind that it was created without the explicit use of `def` keyword!  Finally,
we can call `foo` without arguments and return the value it is storing inside
the closure.

Lexical closures are a powerful concept in FP that is commonly used in Python
for writing function decorators. For a more detailed introduction to
first-class functions head to [Dan's
post](https://dbader.org/blog/python-first-class-functions) where this topic is
addressed in a structured pedagogic way.

### Using First-class Functions for Storing States

Let's see how class instances store state inside objects. We will build a class
called `RoseFlower` which keeps information about height of a rose flower in
centimeters. This class has two instance methods: `measure` which allows us to
measure flower's height and `water` which allows us to water our beautiful rose
flower. However, there is a limit to how tall a rose flower can grow. After the
flower reaches that limit it stops growing. Here is the code[^1]:

```py
class RoseFlower:
    def __init__(self, height):
        self.height = height

    def measure(self):
        return self.height

    def water(self, water_cups):
        if (height := self.height + water_cups*0.25) <= (max_height := 50.0):
            self.height = height
        else:
            self.height = max_height
```

Now, we can create a single rose flower instance and store flower's height
inside it. We can also measure the flower's height using the `measure` method:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> red_rose = RoseFlower(12.5)
>>> red_rose.measure()
12.5
```

Otherwise, we can give it one cup of water so that it grows: 

```py noLineNumbers
>>> red_rose.water(1)
>>> red_rose.measure()
12.75
```

Every time we call `water` method our instance mutates and it's height
attribute changes. If we call `water` method several times the value of the
height attribute increases but the instance keeps the same reference in memory.
Let's take a look at the following example[^2]:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> white_rose = RoseFlower(16.1)
>>> id(white_rose)
140559360210736
>>> white_rose.water(1)
>>> id(white_rose)
140559360210736
```

Although this is a simple example of OOP it sums up the process of storing
state inside an object and mutating it.

Using first-class functions and lexical closures we can replicate the behaviour
of `RoseFlower` class. Let's take a look at how we can apply FP concepts for
the same problem. We will decorate our garden by building a new flower type
called `TulipFlower`:

```py
def TulipFlower(height):
    def constructor():
        return height
    return constructor
```

Notice that `TulipFlower` has the same code as the `first_class_function` that
we've used previously. To create an instance of `TulipFlower` we can use the
following:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> orange_tulip = TulipFlower(21.05)
>>> pink_tulip = TulipFlower(10.25)
```

Because of the lexical closure function objects `pink_tulip` and `orange_tulip`
store the `height` argument that was passed to `TulipFlower`. Namely, we use
`constructor` to "memorize" the value of `height`.

We would also like to access the value stored inside our new instance. Instead
of being lazy and calling tulip objects without arguments to return their
height let's build a simple function called `measure` that does that:

```py noLineNumbers
def measure(tulip):
     return tulip()

>>> measure(orange_tulip)
21.05
>>> measure(pink_tulip)
10.25
```

At this point we can create other functions that will work with tulip objects.
Let's make a function which allows us to interact with our beautiful tulips. We
will water them and they will grow, but since they are tulips we know that they
cannot grow above a certain height. Here is the code[^1]: 

```py
def water(tulip, water_cups):
    if (height := measure(tulip) + water_cups*0.25) <= (max_height := 50.0):
        return TulipFlower(height)
    else:
        return TulipFlower(max_height)
```

Now, let's use `water` function to water our lovely `pink_tulip` with one cup
of water at a time:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> pink_tulip_after_1cup = water(pink_tulip, 1)
>>> pink_tulip_after_2cup = water(pink_tulip_after_1cup, 1)
>>> pink_tulip_after_3cup = water(pink_tulip_after_2cup, 1)
>>> pink_tulip_after_4cup = water(pink_tulip_after_3cup, 1)
>>> measure(pink_tulip_after_4cup)
11.25
```

Here you see prototype-based OOP in action! Every time we apply `water`
function it returns a new instance of a tulip flower. This is referred to as
the so-called *prototype-base OOP* (a well-known concept to JavaScript
programmers). It means that every time `water` is called the function takes a
prototype object and modifies it in order to create a new instance. We can
check this with the `id` function:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> id(pink_tulip)
140559358724704
>>> id(pink_tulip_after_1cup)
140559341576048
```

We are certain that `water` function is returning a new object every time it is
called because `pink_tulip` and `pink_tulip_after_1cup` are not the same object.
Notice that cloning an object and modifying it to create a new object is a
natural result of using FP.

You might think that calling a function several times and naming it is tedious
but it is actually preferred because it protects us from having state
variables. This is the reasons why it is easier to keep track of *the flow*
rather than *the state* in asynchronous programs. We can rewrite the above code
in a compact way using Python's support for FP located inside the
[`functools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) module:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> from functools import reduce
>>> pink_tulip_after_4cup = reduce(water, (1,1,1,1), pink_tulip)
>>> measure(pink_tulip_after_4cup)
11.25
```

This is equivalent to:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> pink_tulip_after_4cup = water(water(water(water(pink_tulip, 1), 1), 1), 1)
>>> measure(pink_tulip_after_4cup)
11.25
```

As you can see `reduce` is a valuable tool in the world of FP.

### Conclusion

We have introduced the concept of first-class functions and showed that Python
has such support. Without lexical closures it would be impossible to do FP
because we wouldn't be able to "memorize" information and store it inside
functions.

We have implemented a class called `RoseFlower` using the classical OOP
approach. The example was used to demonstrate how state is stored inside
objects in OOP and how the objects mutate. Later, we considered the same
problem by taking the FP approach. We've implemented a function called
`TulipFlower` and seen that we can use it to create objects and store
information in them. However, using the FP approach there was no object
mutation and our functions were pure.

I hope that this excesses at least convinced you that OOP and FP are more
similar than you thought and (fingers crossed) that it your sparked interest
for further exploration of the dazzling world of FP.

[^1]: Because we're using the walrus operator (`:=`) this code block is
supported only in Python >= 3.8.

[^2]: The `id` function will most likely have a different return value in your
Python interpreter.
