In Python the `for` statement is an important tool used for specifying
iteration. This article (literally) goes over the `for` statement and uncovers
the mechanism that makes it tick. Before disassembling the `for` statement
we'll first look at the way it is used and from there slowly start diving into
the internals.

### The `for` Statement 101

The `for` statement acts as an interface for iterating over elements
inside objects. The most obvious way for a C programmer to iterate
over an object in Python is the following:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> for i in range(len(planets)):
...     print(planets[i])
...
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
```

The idea here is to create an index variable `i` from an arithmetic progression
using the built-in `range` function which goes from zero up to but not
including `len(planets)`. The index variable is used with the container object
in following way `planets[i]` to retrieve the elements one by one in each
iteration.

The problem with the previous example is that there are several things
happening at the same time making it hard to separate the "business logic" in
the code from the boilerplate required for iterating. In order to iterate over
elements of a container object programmer has to build an arithmetic
progression and access the element by referring to index. In a situation with
nested `for` statements the code becomes harder to read and debug. For this
reason, Python provides a better way to iterate over objects.

Let's rewrite the previous code block in a more Pythonic way:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> for planet in planets:
...    print(planet)
...
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
```

Now this is much better because the "business logic" inside the loop is clear.
Notice how the `for` loop actually behaves as the [foreach
loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach_loop) where Python simply knows how
to iterate over every element inside the `planets` without programmer having to
refer to indexes. We've introduced variable `planet` which is an iteration
variable and gets updated in each iteration with a new element from the `for`
loop. This behaviour removes the noise of building an arithmetic progression
and referring to objects with indexes. At the same time it gives a more
intuitive iteration experience since the code can be read as pseudo code.

In terms of performance
[looping_performance.py](https://gist.github.com/vezeli/31986659ce6fa808c11bad3ebba428a7)
is a script that measures the execution time of the two examples and shows that
the second example preforms significantly faster than iterating using indexes.

### Feeding the `for` Statement With Iterables

Until now I've deliberately avoided talking about the type of objects which
were passed into the `for` statement. At this point, however, I'd like to focus
on the following question: "What type of objects can we pass into the `for`
statement?"

In the previous examples, we've ignorantly passed two different types of
objects into the `for` statement (`range`[^1] and `tuple`) and assumed that
Python knows how to iterate over these objects. That being said, what would
happen if we try to iterate over an object of type integer (`int`)? Let's take
a look at the following example:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> for number in 42:
...    print(number)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

Here we get an error message! More specifically, Python gives us a `TypeError`
saying that it doesn't know how to iterate over `int` objects because
apparently `int` is not an _iterable_. With a bit of help from Python, in this
example we came to the conclusion that in order for an object to get along with
the `for` statement it has to be iterable.

An iterable is an object that knows how to return its members one at a time.
Iterable objects are required to implement either `__iter__` or `__getitem__`
methods. These methods tell Python the order in which it should return elements
inside the iterable. Many of the default types such as `list`, `tuple`, `dict`
and others are iterable and we don't have to worrying about implementing their
dunder methods, we simply pass them into the `for` statement.

In order to see if an object is iterable we can call the `iter` built-in
function and pass the object as an argument. Here's an example of passing an
object of type `list` as an argument inside the `iter` function:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> iter(planets)
<tuple_iterator object at 0x7f83e198bbe0>
```

We can see that this call was successful because we didn't get any error!
However, if we try doing the same with an integer argument we get the following
message:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> iter(42)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

Notice that this error message is identical to the one we got when we passed an
`int` to the `for` statement!

### The Mechanism Behind the `for` Statement

Python has no way of knowing how to iterate over an object passed to the `for`
statement and therefore it calls the `iter` built-in function with the object
as an argument to get help. This is the reason we get the exact same error
message when passing `int` object to the `for` statement and the `iter`
function.

The `iter` function searches the `__iter__` and `__getitem__` methods inside
the object to find the order in which elements should be iterated over and
returns a very simple object called _iterator_ (not to be mistaken for
iterable). The iterator is responsible for telling the `for` statement exactly
how to iterate over the iterable object through a method called `__next__`. An
iterator object can be called with Python's `next` function to return an
element from the iterable that was used for creating the iterator. Once all the
elements from have been returned `next` function raises a `StopIteration`
exception. 

Hopefully, at this point you understand that the `for` statement is top of an
iceberg when it comes to iteration. Under the surface there are functions like
`iter` and `next` that do a lot of work. Therefore, the `for` statement is
considered more of an interface for interacting with iterable objects. We can
rewrite the example with `planets` and expose the mechanism behind the `for`
statement:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> iplanets = iter(planets)
>>> while True:
...     try:
...         planet = next(iplanets)
...     except StopIteration:
...         break
...     else:
...         print(planet)
...
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
```

Let's go over the details one more time: `planets` is an iterable object which
means that it can be iterated over since it implements `__iter__` or
`__getitem__` method. Calling the `iter` function on an iterable object returns
an iterator with `__next__` method. Afterwards, the iterator object is passed
to the `next` function inside an infinite loop and it returns elements from the
`planets` object. After the iterator returned every object it gets exhausted
and raises a `StopIteraton` exception at which point Python exits the infinite
loop.

#### Adding an `else` Clause

The `else` clause that follows the `for` statement is not a well-known or used
feature but it is a part of Python's flow control. The previously described
mechanism need to be slightly modified in order to support the `else` clause.
Here's how the code looks with the `else` clause:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> iplanets = iter(planets)
>>> _loop = True
>>> while _loop:
...     try:
...         planet = next(iplanets)
...     except StopIteration:
...         _loop = False
...     else:
...         print(planet)
... else:
...     print(f"The `break` statement didn't interrupt the loop!")
...
Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars
The `break` statement didn't interrupt the loop!
```

In case of the `while` statement Python runs the code inside the `else` clause
only when the logical expression in the `while` loop becomes `False`.
Therefore, we only have to changed the way of exiting the infinite loop:
instead of using the `break` statement in this case the loop terminates with
`_loop = False`.

With this implementation, the `else` clause shouldn't run when we use the
`break` statement inside the loop body. Let's add only two lines which include
the `break` statement in the loop of the code and test if the `else` clause
runs:

```py  noLineNumbers
>>> planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars",)
>>> iplanets = iter(planets)
>>> _loop = True
>>> while _loop:
...     try:
...         planet = next(iplanets)
...     except StopIteration:
...         _loop = False
...     else:
...         print(planet)
...         if planet == "Earth":
...             break
... else:
...     print(f"The `break` statement didn't interrupt the loop!")
...
Mercury
Venus
Earth
```

The test uses the `break` statement to exit the loop when the iteration reaches
the `"Earth"` object and the `else` clause doesn't run. Our test was a success!

### Conclusion

We've seen that the `for` statement represents syntactic sugar which acts as an
interface for interacting with iterable objects. Additionally, we've exposed
the underlying mechanism and showed that under the surface the `for` statement
calls the `iter` and `next` built-in functions. Hopefully, you've realized that
the iterator protocol lies in the heart of Python's iteration.
