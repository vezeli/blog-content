Python is a high-level programming language that promotes the idea of having
readable code. At the same time, it is an imperative programming language that
makes heavy use of the flow control statements. One of the flow control
statements is the `for` statement which is commonly used for iterating over a
certain part of code until a condition is met.

### Common Usage

A common anti-pattern is to use the `for` statement together with `range` and
`len` functions to iterate over objects using indexes. Here's an example:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> numbers = "42"
>>> for i in range(len(numbers)):
...     print(numbers[i])
...
4
2
```

Even though retrieving items from a sequence performs as O(1), this way of
iterating over objects is considered a bad practice. It indicates that the
programmer has a strong accent carried over from another programming language.

Instead, the `for` statement is aimed to improve readability. It provides a
framework for iterating over *iterable* objects (any object whose class
implements `__iter__` or `__getitem__`) one element at the time. Namely, in the
previous example we iterate over a range-type object that has both dunder
methods implemented by default. Let's rewrite the previous code block in a
Pythonic way:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> numbers = "42"
>>> for number in numbers:
...    print(number)
...
4
2
```

Now this is much better! Notice that Python's `for` loop is actually what is
known as the [foreach loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach_loop) and it
removes the noise of referring to an object with indexes making the code
cleaner. At the same time it gives a more intuitive iteration experience since
the code can be read as pseudo code. Instead of referring to an object with
indexes Python defines a new variable `number` which gets updated in every
iteration. The new variable behaves like any other variable in Python and is
not bounded to the namespace of the loop (meaning that the variable exists even
after the loop is over). Therefore, be careful not to clobber another variable
with the same name.

Additionally, mutating an object while iterating over it is not recommended and
can lead to nasty bugs. There are a dozen of ways to mutate an object. However,
without accessing indexes the beginner programmers are discouraged from this
idea.

### Mechanism Behind the `for` Statement

The `for` statement is actually syntactic sugar that represents an interface
for interacting with iterable and iterator objects. Desugarizing the previous
example exposes the underlying mechanism:

```py noLineNumbers
>>> numbers = "42"
>>> inumbers = iter(numbers)
>>> while True:
...     try:
...         number = next(inumbers)
...         print(number)
...     except StopIteration:
...         break
...
4
2
```

Behind the scenes Python takes the object passed in the `for` statement and
calls `iter` built-in function on it. If the object is iterable `iter` returns
an iterator (an object with `__next__` method and `__iter__` method that
returns `self`) otherwise it returns `TypeError`. Afterwards, the iterator is
passed as an argument to the `next` built-in function returning one value at
the time until the iterator is exhausted at which point it raises the
`StopIteration` exception and breaks out of the loop (see
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators)).

In the previous examples, we've seen that we can iterate over string-type
objects. The reason for this is that many built-in types in Python implement
either `__iter__` or `__getitem__` dunder methods by default. It tells Python
how to iterate over an object. Therefore, objects types such as `list`,
`tuple`, `string` are considered to be iterable objects or simply *iterables*.

### Conclusion

The mechanism behind the `for` statement allows Python to iterate over any
object `obj` that implements `__iter__` or `__getitem__` method. As long as
`iter(obj)` returns an valid iterator (with `__next__` method and `__iter__`
method that returns `self`) Python is able to loop over `obj`. If at this point
you feel that you'd like to learn more about iterators and iterables I'd
recommend heading to [Tray's
